### A MLM-based Defense Method Against Textual Adversarial Examples


The Code directory includes our defense approach implementation plus three pipelines. **Text_attack** pipeline is the main one in which we generate adversarial examples and test our approach on attacked data. The **scRNN** file is the pipeline for calculating the accuracy of Semi Character RNN baseline on various datasets. Data Augmentation and Adversarial Training baselines are implemented in **AT**.
Dataset directory contains generated adversarial examples and the outputs of our approach.
